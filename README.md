# TomatoPhagy
**Autophagy in tomato fruit ripening**

Hi, 

You have reached our TomatoPhagy repository.
A joint effort of Szymanski lab at IPK Gatersleben (Germany) and Michaeli lab at Volcani Center (Israel).
We will fill this place with life as soon as the project starts.
Stay tuned.

Best wishes,

The TomatoPhagy Team
